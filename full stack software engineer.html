I have relevant work experience on database system administration and knowledge on SQL that will hope me to solve the issue that occurs in database application development. About the programming languages I have my basic knowledge on most of the  programming languages like Java, C C++, C# & python. 
    On backend application I do have knowledge on php, Ruby, rail and asp.net, then lately I have worked on some freelance project on big data and crating website for small business. So after gaining relevant working experience and gaining more knowledge on most of the Application and tools on web technologies, I will be able to perform the roles and responsibilities of a full stack software developer/engineer.</p>
