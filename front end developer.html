          <p>For past couple of weeks I have worked on HTML, CSS and JavaScript i have counter numbers of issues while testing the scripts, design and documents on website, questioning my self to make the website more interactive and responsive to the end users thus encouraging me to come up with my own thoughts and solutions to built a website from scratch. then learning more options on design, scripts and markup languages build up my confidence that I will be able to do a job as a front end developer. Although I do have fare knowledge in the frontend applications and tools as I have work on web technologies before and build couple of website for businesses.</p>
